# UAC-Bypass-CPP
Windows UAC Bypass using cmstp.exe written in cpp 

The CMSTP UAC bypass is a well known method that existed for a long time.
Microsoft considers this behaviour to be expected and as of today has no intention of fixing it 

Because of its longevity this method has been abused by many well known and highly dangerous malware families 
to bypass administrator privileges and modify system settings such as adding themselves to security exclusions 
example : XWorm version 6 and above

This method has not been patched and remains functional.

Everything presented in this project is for educational and research purposes.
